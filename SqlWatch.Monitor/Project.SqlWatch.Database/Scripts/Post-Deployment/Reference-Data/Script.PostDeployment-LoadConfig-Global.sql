	/*	This is similar to Last Seen Items (date_last_seen) retention days

		with the flag set to 1 and date last seen older than the hours below. 
		The difference is that the last seen is non deterministic - the object
		may exist but we have not checked for it yet. 
		The deleted flag is deterministic and it means we have checked and the 
		object does not exist for sure.

		** THIS IS NOT YET USED BECUASE IT WILL NOT WORK WITH CENTRAL REPOSITORY
		   IF WE DELETE THE RECORD IN SOURCE, THE CENTRAL REPO WILL STILL HAVE IT
		   UNTIL WE RUN A FULL MERGE LOAD WHICH WE WOULD HAVE TO DO PERIODICALLY
		   WHICH IS ALSO QUITE RESOURCE HEAVY AND WOULD REQUIRE LOTS OF .NET CHANGES 
		   IT IS EASIER TO JUST LET THE RECORDS DROP OFF AFTER PERIOD OF LAST_SEEN_DATE 
		   INSTEAD, WE COULD CHANGE THE Last Seen Items (date_last_seen) retention days TO HOURS
		   AND HAVE RECORDS DROP OFF AFTER 1 HOUR OF NOT BEING SEEN - ALTHOUGH THERE'S A RISK THAT IF
		   THE OBJECT EXISTS BUT WE FAIL TO COLLECT IT, OR IF THE CENTRAL REPO IMPORT RUNS RARELY, 
		   THE LAST SEEN WILL NOT BE UPDATED AND MAY BE DELETED PREMATURELY.
